1. read input file 
2. Create T and P - matrix


Design common solution sequence
Create printer for the solution sequence


ACO:
1. pheromone matrix
2. distance heuristic
3. create environment graph
Key words: pheromones, ants, trail etc

PSO:
Key words: swarm, birds

Goals:
1 common solution-representation [Feasible sequence der der alts√•]
1 common scheduler/Gantt-printer
